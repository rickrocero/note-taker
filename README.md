# Express.js Note Taker

## Description
My motivation was to build the backend portion of a note taker web app using the Express.js framework for node.js. I built the backend to be able to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. The backend now allows a note taker web app user to store their inputs in a mock database in this case it is the db.json file so that it can be fetched and rendered by the frontend code. This project taught me how to store persistant data with express.js and implement RESTful API architecture using the http methods get and post.
